### About Me
Hi! Im Cassandra Garza. I usually go by Cass. I have found my passion in tech and am currently president of Frontera Devs, a student-led organization dedicated to empowering developers with the resources they need to become leaders in tech including hands-on learning opportunities and mentorship programs. Our vision is to be our community's primary developer community; an environment where we eliminate barriers in tech and enable developers to discover new technologies and innovate.

I am currently advancing my data science skills by experimenting with machine learning.
